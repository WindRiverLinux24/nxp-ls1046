  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged v6.1/standard/base..v6.1/standard/nxp-sdk-6.1/nxp-soc


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "kernelfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyS0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x90000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x81000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $kernel_addr_r $kernelfile; \
tftp $fdt_addr_r $fdtfile;booti $kernel_addr_r - $fdt_addr_r
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
kernel_addr_r=0x81000000
fdt_addr_r=0x90000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
kernelfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-ls1046-rdb-sdk.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS0
baudrate=115200
othbootargs=earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500

4.2 Booting from SPI flash
--------------------------

4.2.1 On-Board SPI Flash vbank Configuration

The LS1046ARDB provides two QSPI flash memories (part number: S25FS512SDSMFI011) 
for storing images (RCW/UBoot/kernel/PPA/FMan microcode):
 - Flash memory connected to chip select 0 (CS0): Represents the default virtual bank (bank 0)
 - Flash memory connected to chip select 1 (CS1): Represents the alternative virtual bank (bank 4)
Below description shows the memory addresses (memory map) for storing board configuration data on 
virtual bank 0 and virtual bank 4.

4.2.2 NXP bootloader image

WRLinux product provides a solution to build bootloader image which contains U-Boot, RCW, etc.
Please refer to section 6 to build NXP bootloader image.

After building, the bootloader image(firmware_ls1046ardb_uboot_<boot-type>.img) is generated
in directory <building-path>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046.

and burn it to the target board under the U-Boot prompt using the commands below:

=> tftp a0000000 firmware_ls1046ardb_qspiboot.img
=> sf probe 0:1
=> sf erase 0 +$filesize && sf write a0000000 0 $filesize

Then use

=> cpld reset altbank

to switch to vbank4.

4.2.3 Set board switch

Set dipsw as below for booting from flash0
SW3[1:8] 		SW4[1:8] 		SW5[1:8]
01000110 		00111011 		00100010

Set dipsw as below for booting from flash1
SW3[1:8] 		SW4[1:8] 		SW5[1:8]
01001110 		00111011 		00100010

4.3 NAND Flash Root File System
-------------------------------

4.3.1 Generate the boot image

Configure your project with the following options to enable necessary kernel
options:
        --templates feature/yaffs2-utils

After build, program the image into flash with following command:
For ubifs filesystems:
	# flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
	# ubiattach /dev/ubi_ctrl -m 0
	# ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N root -s 480MiB
	# mkdir /mnt/ubifs
	# mount -t ubifs ubi0:root /mnt/ubifs
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-glibc-std-nxp-ls1046.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/ubifs/
	# umount /mnt/ubifs/

The followings are for YAFFS2 filesystem:

	# flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
	# mkdir /mnt/yaffs2
	# mount -t yaffs /dev/mtdblock0 /mnt/yaffs2
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-glibc-std-nxp-ls1046.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/yaffs2/
	# umount /mnt/yaffs2/

NOTE: Before writing to the flash memory you need to know its layout, you can
get this kind information by running 'cat /proc/mtd' on your target. please
ensure that an appropriate file system is created to fit the available space.

4.3.2 Deployment
----------------

After loading the kernel, pass kernel arguments as shown:

	ubi.mtd=0 root=ubi0:root rw rootfstype=ubifs console=ttyS0,115200

	or: root=/dev/mtdblock0 rw rootfstype=yaffs console=ttyS0,115200

4.4 Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
------------------------------------
User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

WIC image for SD card:
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1046.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card. WIC image contains kernel,
dtb, rootfs and bootloader(if customer builds it by following the section 6).

To change default booting configuration in uboot, user can overwrite following
variable in uboot and save to SD by saveenv command:

- kernelfile, define kernel image file name.
- fdtfile, define device-tree image file name.
- othbootargs, define additional booting parameters pass to kernel.

4.4.1 Burn images to SD card
----------------------------

To burn images to SD card, user needs to follow two steps:

1) Generate WIC image with NXP bootloader

WRLinux product provides a solution to build WIC image with NXP bootloader.
Please refer to section 6 for the detailed description.
After building, the WIC image(wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1046.wic) is generated
in directory <building-path>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046.

2) Burn WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1046.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

4.4.2 Set board switch
----------------------

Board can boot from SD card by setting sw4[1:8] as '00111011' and sw5[1:8] as '00100000'.
After power up, if a bootable SD card inserted, then system will boot from SD
card.

5.2 kexec/kdump
---------------

To build the boot or capture kernel, use the following option with the configure
command for your project:

     --templates feature/kexec feature/kdump

To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, pass "crashkernel=512M"
via the U-Boot command line.

NOTES:
1. Use Image as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the directory
   tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046/Image

2. 512 MB (the size of the memory reserved for crash kernel) is the
   recommended amount of memory. If you add more features to the kernel, you
   can increase this value to accommodate the capture kernel.

3. Kdump
   SMP is unsupported in the 2nd kernel, so user needs to append argument "maxcpus=1"
   in the 2nd kernel bootargs.
   Because the 2nd kernel runs under limited resource, it should not work as a
   "replacement" kernel. In contrast, the only purpose of the 2nd kernel is to collect
   the crashing information of the 1st kernel.

4. Same with LSDK, DPAA1 should be compiled out while creating the image for
   dump-capture 2nd kernel. With "CONFIG_FSL_SDK_DPAA_ETH=n"
   in the kernel .config setting to disable DPAA1, user can choose PCIe device "CONFIG_E1000E=y"
   as a replacement to make NFS working.
   Please refer to the chapter 7.6 "kdump/kexec User Manual" of "LLDPUG_RevL6.1.1-1.0.0.pdf".

For more detailed information about kdump, please refer to
Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt in the kernel source tree.

5.3 DPDK
--------

5.3.1 Install DPDK
------------------

Refer to the README file in dpdk feature directory(layers/wrlinux/templates/feature/dpdk).

5.4 LS1026A
-----------

Enable LS1026A mode by setting sw3[2] as 0.
sw3[2] definition for LS1046A processor as below:
 0: Disable cores 3 and 4
 1: Enable all cores (default value)

Note:
When booting up system with LS1026A mode, please use fsl-ls1026a-rdb-sdk.dtb file.


6. Build Bootloader
===================

Because of license limitation, the NXP ls1046 bootloader is not supported on WRLinux product.
But the necessary recipe files of building bootloader have been integrated into WRLinux product. In this way,
the customers can build bootloader for NXP ls1046 platform based on WRLinux product by themselves.
To build bootloader image for NXP ls1046 platform, it only needs to add below contents in local.conf file,
and then build WRLinux image as usual.

	BB_NO_NETWORK = '0'
	ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"
	CUSTOMER_BUILD_BOOTLOADER = "1"
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'secure-boot-qoriq'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'u-boot-qoriq'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-qoriq += 'qoriq-atf'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'fm-ucode'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'qe-ucode'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'qoriq-cst-native'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'uefi'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'rcw'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:freescale-layer += 'ls2-phy'

Note: If customers want to integrate bootloader into their own product, they MUST consult NXP and their own
      legal department.
